<!--## Featured Projects-->

## Tools

#### [Image Dataset labeler](https://github.com/sagecodes/image-data-labeler)

I needed a quick and simple way manually label images into seperate datasets so I made this tool using `python`, `openCV`, & `keyboard`. Someone who used this tool told me it improved their labeling time by more than 75%!

## Data Visualizations


## Web Development

### Projects:
___

#### [SageElliott.com](https://github.com/sagecodes/sage-blog)

Uses `Jekyll`, `Bootstrap`, and `Ruby` to make a static website generator. I host my blog posts, projects and more on this site. Check it out [here](https://sageelliott.com/).

----

#### [Block3](https://github.com/sagecodes/block3)

Created a landing page for block3. A blockchain workspace and knowledge hub in Seattle.

Since no complicated were needed for the page I decided to use plain `HTML` and `CSS` to accomplish structure and styling. I used the built in `CSS Grid` property for responsive design.

----

#### [Froggerish](https://github.com/sagecodes/froggerish)

An HTML5 Canvas powered video game, developed using the best practices in Object Oriented JavaScript. Extra features: Score and loss counter, increased difficulty as your score progresses, and random character sprite on page load.

----

#### [Dev Profile](https://github.com/sagecodes/devpost)

Developed a content management system using the Flask framework in Python. Authentication is provided via OAuth and all data is stored within a PostgreSQL database.

Original use was to replace Udacity student profiles with added features such as displaying projects outside of curriculum, but Udacity updated profiles to include all extra features.

----

#### [Conference Central](https://github.com/sagecodes/conference-central)

Using Google App Engineâ€™s Endpoints API, built the Python backend to support a web- and Android-based conference organization application.
